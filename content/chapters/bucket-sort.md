# Bucket Sort

**Time Complexity:**

- Average: $O(n + k)$
- Worst: $O(n^2)$
  **Space Complexity:** $O(n + k)$
  **Stability:** _Can be stable_

---

**When to use:**
Input is **uniformly distributed** over a range.

---

**Algorithm:**

1. Create `k` empty buckets.
2. Distribute elements into buckets based on value.
3. Sort each bucket (e.g., with insertion sort).
4. Concatenate buckets.
