# Counting Sort

**Time Complexity:** $O(n + k)$ where `k` is range of input
**Space Complexity:** $O(k)$
**Stability:** _Can be stable_ (with proper implementation)

---

**When to use:**
When input values are integers in a **small, known range**.

---

**Algorithm (Placeholder):**

```python
# Implementation coming soon...
```
