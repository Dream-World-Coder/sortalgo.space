side bar is nav, add a tab of table of contents here : no, csr needed, later

landing page is the book structure, divide it and make book
or just simple scroll = yes

sidebar hide btn = no
smaller font maybe = no

sitemap, manifest, favicon : done

-- [] update the title & descriptions
-- [] add social links for authors

instead of depending on seperate chapters data [src/app/lib/chapters.ts], i can just create sub folders, for ordering i can add their serials in prefix, like 1_intro etc & trim it.
but the problem it has is the folders name, file name will be almost same [except trim/ replace],
& its a small project anyways
